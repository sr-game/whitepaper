### **Creating Account**

&#x20;   There are several wallets that support wax blockchain. However, we recommend using WCW (Wax Cloud Wallet) or Anchor.&#x20;

#### Wax Cloud Wallet

&#x20;   The _WAX_ Cloud _Wallet_ is the easiest way to create, use, and manage an account on the _WAX_ blockchain. The Wax Cloud wallet is a super user friendly web wallet for the Wax Blockchain.
