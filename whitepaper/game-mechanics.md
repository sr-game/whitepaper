#### Buy Map

&#x20;   Each map needs to be purchased by the player, and each map can only use shoes of no greater than the current level.

&#x20;   The validity period after each purchase of the map is as follows:

| Level | Validity periodï¼ˆdayï¼‰ |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| 1     | 3                    |
| 2     | 15                   |
| 3     | 15                   |
| 4     | 15                   |
| 5     | 15                   |
| 6     | 15                   |

_The starting time of the map's validity period is the time of the first use of \[ run ]_

<mark style="color:red;">After the validity period of the map expires, you need to purchase a new map to continue using it.</mark>

#### Wear Shoes

&#x20;   After purchasing a map, players need to wear different levels of shoes on maps of different levels in order to obtain benefits from the map normally.

#### Run

&#x20;  ~~Use \[run] in the game to get the daily income of the map. When the newly purchased map is used for the first time \[run], it needs to be used once a day within the validity period of the map. If it is not used for one or more days , the income for the corresponding days will be lost, and after the map expires, the amount of the purchased map will be returned.~~
